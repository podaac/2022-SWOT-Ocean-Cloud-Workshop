    "text": "About\nWorkshop Goal The goal of the workshop is to get ready for Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) and enable the (oceanography) science team to be ready for processing and handling the large volumes of SWOT SSH data in the cloud. Learning objectives focus on how to access the SWOT L2 SSH simulated data from Earthdata Cloud either by downloading or accessing the data on the cloud. PO.DAAC is the NASA archive for the SWOT mission, and once launched will be making data available via the NASA Earthdata Cloud, hosted in AWS.\nWorkshop Description The workshop has two main components: (1) Pre-event materials will be sent ahead of the workshop and will cover how to access and download cloud-archived SWOT L2 SSH simulated data from the Earthdata Cloud. This material will also be made available on this site, under Logistics, in early February. (2) At the workshop the focus wil be on in-could workflows, where no data download is required and data analysis can take place next to the data in the cloud. During the “hacking” time at the workshop participants can choose to employ the “download and analyze locally” or the “in-cloud analysis” paradigm for working with the SWOT L2 SSH simulated data. For the in-cloud workflows, cloud accounts will be provided for the workshop. PO.DAAC will provide necessary tech support during the hands-on “hacking” time.\nWorkshop Outcomes At the end of the two days, participants should be able to access the simulated SWOT data that is archived in the NASA EArthdata Cloud (hosted in AWS) and at minimum, subset and plot a time series of their favorite region, if not more. Participants are encouraged to coordinate amongst their respective SWOT ST project to figure out who will be attending. If the project would like more than one person to attend that is welcomed, just note that as a project you will need to agree on what use case you want to work on. Even if the team members amongst the project are cloud savvy, it is still strongly recommended that there is a representative attending, as this workshop will specifically be covering the SWOT simulated data."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This tutorial guides you through how to use Earthdata Search for NASA Earth observations search and discovery, and how to connect the search output (e.g. download or access links) to a programmatic workflow (locally or from within the cloud).\n\nStep 1. Go to Earthdata Search and Login\nGo to Earthdata Search https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov and use your Earthdata login credentials to log in. If you do not have an Earthdata account, please see the Workshop Prerequisites for guidance.\n\n\nStep 2. Search for dataset of interest\nUse the search box in the upper left to type key words. In this example we are interested in the ECCO dataset, hosted by the PO.DAAC. This dataset is available from the NASA Earthdata Cloud archive hosted in AWS cloud.\nClick on the “Available from AWS Cloud” filter option on the left. Here, 104 matching collections were found with the basic ECCO search.\n\n\n\nFigure caption: Search for ECCO data available in AWS cloud in Earthdata Search portal\n\n\nLet’s refine our search further. Let’s search for ECCO monthly SSH in the search box (which will produce 39 matching collections), and for the time period for year 2015. The latter can be done using the calendar icon on the left under the search box.\nScroll down the list of returned matches until we see the dataset of interest, in this case ECCO Sea Surface Height - Monthly Mean 0.5 Degree (Version 4 Release 4).\nWe can click on the (i) icon for the dataset to read more details, including the dataset shortname (helpful for programmatic workflows) just below the dataset name; here ECCO_L4_SSH_05DEG_MONTHLY_V4R4.\n\n\n\nFigure caption: Refine search, set temporal bounds, get more information\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Explore the dataset details, including Cloud Access information\nOnce we clicked the (i), scrolling down the info page for the dataset we will see Cloud Access information, such as:\n\nwhether the dataset is available in the cloud\nthe cloud Region (all NASA Earthdata Cloud data is/will be in us-west-2 region)\nthe S3 storage bucket and object prefix where this data is located\nlink that generates AWS S3 Credentials for in-cloud data access (we will cover this in the Direct Data Access Tutorials)\nlink to documentation describing the In-region Direct S3 Access to Buckets. Note: these will be unique depending on the DAAC where the data is archived. (We will show examples of direct in-region access in Tutorial 3.)\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption: Cloud access info in EDS\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption: Documentation describing the In-region Direct S3 Access to Buckets\n\n\nPro Tip: Clicking on “For Developers” to exapnd will provide programmatic endpoints such as those for the CMR API, and more. CMR API and CMR STAC API tutorials can be found on the 2021 Cloud Hackathon website.\nFor now, let’s say we are intersted in getting download link(s) or access link(s) for specific data files (granules) within this collection.\nAt the top of the dataset info section, click on Search Results, which will take us back to the list of datasets matching our search parameters. Clicking on the dataset (here again it’s the same ECCO Sea Surface Height - Monthly Mean 0.5 Degree (Version 4 Release 4)) we now see a list of files (granules) that are part of the dataset (collection).\n\n\nStep 4. Customize the download or data access\nClick on the green + symbol to add a few files to our project. Here we added the first 3 listed for 2015. Then click on the green button towards the bottom that says “Download”. This will take us to another page with options to customize our download or access link(s).\n\n\n\nFigure caption: Select granules and click download\n\n\n\n4.a. Entire file content\nLet’s stay we are interested in the entire file content, so we select the “Direct Download” option (as opposed to other options to subset or transform the data):\n\n\n\nFigure caption: Customize your download or access\n\n\nClicking the green Download Data button again, will take us to the final page for instructions to download and links for data access in the cloud. You should see three tabs: Download Files, AWS S3 Access, Download Script:\n  \nThe Download Files tab provides the https:// links for downloading the files locally. E.g.: https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-protected/ECCO_L4_SSH_05DEG_MONTHLY_V4R4/SEA_SURFACE_HEIGHT_mon_mean_2015-09_ECCO_V4r4_latlon_0p50deg.nc\nThe AWS S3 Access tab provides the S3:// links, which is what we would use to access the data directly in-region (us-west-2) within the AWS cloud (an example will be shown in Tutorial 3). E.g.: s3://podaac-ops-cumulus-protected/ECCO_L4_SSH_05DEG_MONTHLY_V4R4/SEA_SURFACE_HEIGHT_mon_mean_2015-09_ECCO_V4r4_latlon_0p50deg.nc where s3 indicates data is stored in AWS S3 storage, podaac-ops-cumulus-protected is the bucket, and ECCO_L4_SSH_05DEG_MONTHLY_V4R4 is the object prefix (the latter two are also listed in the dataset collection information under Cloud Access (step 3 above)).\nTip: Another quicker way to find the bucket and object prefix is from the list of data files the search returns. Next to the + green button is a grey donwload symbol. Click on that to see the Download Files https:// links or on the AWS S3 Access to get the direct S3:// access links, which contain the bucket and object prefix where data is stored.\n\n\n4.b. Subset or transform before download or access\nDAAC tools and services are also being migrated or developed in the cloud, next to that data. These include the Harmony API and OPeNDAP in the cloud, as a few examples.\nWe can leverage these cloud-based services on cloud-archived data to reduce or transform the data (depending on need) before getting the access links regardless of whether we prefer to download the data and work on a local machine or whether we want to access the data in the cloud (from a cloud workspace). These can be useful data reduction services that support a faster time to science.\nHarmony\nHarmony allows you to seamlessly analyze Earth observation data from different NASA data centers. These services (API endpoints) provide data reduction (e.g. subsetting) and transfromation services (e.g. convert netCDF data to Zarr cloud optimized format).\n\n\n\nFigure caption: Leverage Harmony cloud-based data transformation services\n\n\nWhen you click the final green Download button, the links provided are to data that had been transformed based on our selections on the previous screen (here chosing to use the Harmony service to reformat the data to Zarr). These data are staged for us in an S3 bucket in AWS, and we can use the s3:// links to access those specific data. This service also provides STAC access links. This particular example is applicable if your workflow is in the AWS us-west-2 region.\n\n\n\nFigure caption: Harmony-staged data in S3\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Integrate file links into programmatic workflow, locally or in the AWS cloud.\nIn tutorial 3 Direct Data Access, we will work programmatically in the cloud to access datasets of interest, to get us set up for further scientific analysis of choice. There are several ways to do this. One way to connect the search part of the workflow we just did in Earthdata Search to our next steps working in the cloud is to simply copy/paste the s3:// links provides in Step 4 above into a JupyterHub notebook or script in our cloud workspace, and continue the data analysis from there.\nOne could also copy/paste the s3:// links and save them in a text file, then open and read the text file in the notebook or script in the JupyterHub in the cloud.\nTutorial 3 will pick up from here and cover these next steps in more detail."

    "text": "Summary\n\nThis tutorial will combine several workflow steps and components from the previous days, demonstrating the process of using the geolocation of data available outside of the Earthdata Cloud to then access coincident variables of cloud-accessible data. This may be a common use case as NASA Earthdata continues to migrate to the cloud, producing a “hybrid” data archive across Amazon Web Services (AWS) and original on-premise data storage systems. Additionally, you may also want to combine field measurements with remote sensing data available on the Earthdata Cloud.\nThis specific example explores the pairing of the ICESat-2 ATL07 Sea Ice Height data product, currently (as of November 2021) available publicly via direct download at the NSIDC DAAC, along with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from the GHRSST MODIS L2 dataset (MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0) available from PO.DAAC on the Earthdata Cloud.\nThe use case we’re looking at today centers over an area north of Greenland for a single day in June, where a melt pond was observed using the NASA OpenAltimetry application. Melt ponds are an important feature of Arctic sea ice dynamics, leading to an decrease in sea ice albedo and other changes in heat balance. Many NASA Earthdata datasets produce variables including sea ice albedo, sea surface temperature, air temperature, and sea ice height, which can be used to better understand these dynamics."

See the Earthdata Search tutorial for more information on how to use Earthdata Search to discover and access data from the Earthdata Cloud.\n# Bounding Box spatial parameter in decimal degree 'W,S,E,N' format.\nbounding_box = '-62.8,81.7,-56.4,83'\n\n# Each date in yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ format; date range in start,end format\ntemporal = '2019-06-22T00:00:00Z,2019-06-22T23:59:59Z'\nSee the Data Discovery with CMR tutorial for more details on how to navigate the NASA Common Metadata Repository (CMR) Application Programming Interface, or API. For some background, the CMR catalogs all data for NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). The CMR API allows applications (software, services, etc) to send information to each other. A helpful analogy is a waiter in a restaurant. The waiter takes your drink or food order that you select from the menu, often translated into short-hand, to the bar or kitchen, and then returns (hopefully) with what you ordered when it is ready.\nThe CMR API accepts search terms such as collection name, keywords, datetime range, and location, queries the CMR database and returns the results.\nFor this tutorial, we have already identified the unique identifier, or concept_id for each dataset:\nmodis_concept_id = 'C1940473819-POCLOUD'\nicesat2_concept_id = 'C2003771980-NSIDC_ECS'\nThis Earthdata Search Project also provides the same data access links that we will identify in the following steps for each dataset (note that you will need an Earthdata Login account to access this project)."

We are working together to develop a shared library of resources - including existing resources, new code, tutorials, and use-cases/examples - that simplify the process of querying, obtaining, analyzing, and manipulating ICESat-2 datasets to enable scientific discovery.” - NSIDC DAAC Data Access and Service API - The API provided by the NSIDC DAAC allows you to access data programmatically using specific temporal and spatial filters. The same subsetting, reformatting, and reprojection services available on select data sets through NASA Earthdata Search can also be applied using this API. - IceFlow - The IceFlow python library simplifies accessing and combining data from several of NASA’s cryospheric altimetry missions, including ICESat/GLAS, Operation IceBridge, and ICESat-2. In particular, IceFlow harmonizes the various file formats and georeferencing parameters across several of the missions’ data sets, allowing you to analyze data across the multi-decadal time series.\nWe’ve found 2 granules. We’ll download the first one and write it to a file with the same name as the producer_granule_id.\nWe need the url for the granule as well. This is href links we printed out above.\nicesat_id = granules[0]['producer_granule_id']\nicesat_url = granules[0]['links'][0]['href']\nTo retrieve the granule data, we use the requests.get() method, which will utilize the .netrc file on the backend to authenticate the request against Earthdata Login.\nr = requests.get(icesat_url)\nThe response returned by requests has the same structure as all the other responses: a header and contents. The header information has information about the response, including the size of the data we downloaded in bytes.\n\nfor k, v in r.headers.items():\n    print(f'{k}: {v}')\n\nDate: Sun, 12 Dec 2021 01:52:31 GMT\nServer: Apache\nVary: User-Agent\nContent-Disposition: attachment\nContent-Length: 248607461\nKeep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n\nThe contents needs to be saved to a file. To keep the directory clean, we will create a downloads directory to store the file. We can use a shell command to do this or use the makedirs method from the os package.\nos.makedirs(\"downloads\", exist_ok=True)\nYou should see a downloads directory in the file browser.\nTo write the data to a file, we use open to open a file. We need to specify that the file is open for writing by using the write-mode w. We also need to specify that we want to write bytes by setting the binary-mode b. This is important because the response contents are bytes. The default mode for open is text-mode. So make sure you use b.\nWe’ll use the with statement context-manager to open the file, write the contents of the response, and then close the file. Once the data in r.content is written sucessfully to the file, or if there is an error, the file is closed by the context-manager.\nWe also need to prepend the downloads path to the filename. We do this using Path from the pathlib package in the standard library.\noutfile = Path('downloads', icesat_id)\nif not outfile.exists():\n    with open(outfile, 'wb') as f:\n        f.write(r.content)\nATL07-01_20190622055317_12980301_004_01.h5 is an HDF5 file. xarray can open this but you need to tell it which group to read the data from. In this case we read the sea ice segment height data for ground-track 1 left-beam. You can explore the variable hierarchy in Earthdata Search, by selecting the Customize option under Download Data.\nThis code block performs the following operations: - Extracts the height_segment_height variable from the heights group, along with the dimension variables contained in the higher level sea_ice_segments group, - Convert attributes from bytestrings to strings, - Drops the HDF attribute DIMENSION_LIST, - Sets _FillValue to NaN\n\nvariable_names = [\n    '/gt1l/sea_ice_segments/latitude',\n    '/gt1l/sea_ice_segments/longitude',\n    '/gt1l/sea_ice_segments/delta_time',\n    '/gt1l/sea_ice_segments/heights/height_segment_height'\n    ]\nwith h5py.File(outfile, 'r') as h5:\n    data_vars = {}\n    for varname in variable_names:\n        var = h5[varname]\n        name = varname.split('/')[-1]\n        #

    "text": "Load data into xarray via S3 direct access\nOur CMR granule search returned 14 files for our time and area of interest. However, not all granules will be suitable for analysis.\nI’ve identified the image with granule id G1956158784-POCLOUD as a good candidate, this is the 9th granule. In this image, our area of interest is close to nadir. This means that the instantaneous field of view over the area of interest cover a smaller area than at the edge of the image.\nWe are looking for the link for direct download access via s3. This is a url but with a prefix s3://. This happens to be the first href link in the metadata.\nFor a single granule we can cut and paste the s3 link. If we have several granules, the s3 links can be extracted with some simple code.\n\ngranule = granules[9]\n\nfor link in granule['links']:\n    if link['href'].startswith('s3://'):\n        s3_link = link['href']\n        \ns3_link\n\n's3://podaac-ops-cumulus-protected/MODIS_A-JPL-L2P-v2019.0/20190622100001-JPL-L2P_GHRSST-SSTskin-MODIS_A-D-v02.0-fv01.0.nc'\n\n\n\nGet S3 credentials\nAs with the previous S3 download tutorials we need credentials to access data from s3: access keys and tokens.\ns3_credentials = requests.get('https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentials').json()\nEssentially, what we are doing in this step is to “mount” the s3 bucket as a file system. This allows us to treat the S3 bucket in a similar way to a local file system.\ns3_fs = s3fs.S3FileSystem(\n    key=s3_credentials[\"accessKeyId\"],\n    secret=s3_credentials[\"secretAccessKey\"],\n    token=s3_credentials[\"sessionToken\"],\n)\n\n\nOpen a s3 file\nNow we have the S3FileSystem set up, we can access the granule. xarray cannot open a S3File directly, so we use the open method for the S3FileSystem to open the granule using the endpoint url we extracted from the metadata. We also have to set the mode='rb'. This opens the granule in read-only mode and in byte-mode. Byte-mode is important. By default, open opens a file as text - in this case it would just be a string of characters - and xarray doesn’t know what to do with that.\nWe then pass the S3File object f to xarray.open_dataset. For this dataset, we also have to set decode_cf=False. This switch tells xarray not to use information contained in variable attributes to generate human readable coordinate variables. Normally, this should work for netcdf files but for this particular cloud-hosted dataset, variable attribute data is not in the form expected by xarray. We’ll fix this.\nf = s3_fs.open(s3_link, mode='rb')\nmodis_ds = xr.open_dataset(f, decode_cf=False)\nIf you click on the Show/Hide Attributes icon (the first document-like icon to the right of coordinate variable metadata) you can see that attributes are one-element arrays containing bytestrings.\n\nmodis_ds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<xarray.Dataset>\nDimensions:                  (nj: 2030, ni: 1354, time: 1)\nCoordinates:\n  * time                     (time) int32 1214042401\nDimensions without coordinates: nj, ni\nData variables:\n    lat                      (nj, ni) float32 ...\n    lon                      (nj, ni) float32 ...\n    sea_surface_temperature  (time, nj, ni) int16 ...\n    sst_dtime                (time, nj, ni) int16 ...\n    quality_level            (time, nj, ni) int8 ...\n    sses_bias                (time, nj, ni) int8 ...\n    sses_standard_deviation  (time, nj, ni) int8 ...\n    l2p_flags                (time, nj, ni) int16 ...\n    chlorophyll_a            (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    K_490                    (time, nj, ni) int16 ...\n    wind_speed               (time, nj, ni) int8 ...\n    dt_analysis              (time, nj, ni) int8 ...\nAttributes: (12/49)\n    Conventions:                [b'CF-1.7, ACDD-1.3']\n    title:                      [b'MODIS Aqua L2P SST']\n    summary:                    [b'Sea surface temperature retrievals produce...\n    references:                 [b'GHRSST Data Processing Specification v2r5']\n    institution:                [b'NASA/JPL/OBPG/RSMAS']\n    history:                    [b'MODIS L2P created at JPL PO.DAAC']\n    ...                         ...\n    publisher_email:            [b'ghrsst-po@nceo.ac.uk']\n    processing_level:           [b'L2P']\n    cdm_data_type:              [b'swath']\n    startDirection:             [b'Ascending']\n    endDirection:               [b'Descending']\n    day_night_flag:             [b'Day']xarray.DatasetDimensions:nj: 2030ni: 1354time: 1Coordinates: (1)time(time)int321214042401long_name :[b'reference time of sst file']standard_name :[b'time']units :[b'seconds since 1981-01-01 00:00:00']comment :[b'time of first sensor observation']coverage_content_type :[b'coordinate']array([1214042401], dtype=int32)Data variables: (12)lat(nj, ni)float32...long_name :[b'latitude']standard_name :[b'latitude']units :[b'degrees_north']_FillValue :[-999.]valid_min :[-90.]valid_max :[90.]comment :[b'geographical coordinates, WGS84 projection']coverage_content_type :[b'coordinate'][2748620 values with dtype=float32]lon(nj, ni)float32...long_name :[b'longitude']standard_name :[b'longitude']units :[b'degrees_east']_FillValue :[-999.]valid_min :[-180.]valid_max :[180.]comment :[b'geographical coordinates, WGS84 projection']coverage_content_type :[b'coordinate'][2748620 values with dtype=float32]sea_surface_temperature(time, nj, ni)int16...long_name :[b'sea surface temperature']standard_name :[b'sea_surface_skin_temperature']units :[b'kelvin']_FillValue :[-32767]valid_min :[-1000]valid_max :[10000]comment :[b'sea surface temperature from thermal IR (11 um) channels']scale_factor :[0.005]add_offset :[273.15]source :[b'NASA and University of Miami']coordinates :[b'lon lat']coverage_content_type :[b'physicalMeasurement'][2748620 values with dtype=int16]sst_dtime(time, nj, ni)int16...long_name :[b'time difference from reference time']units :[b'seconds']_FillValue :[-32768]valid_min :[-32767]valid_max :[32767]comment :[b'time plus sst_dtime gives seconds after 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1981']coordinates :[b'lon lat']coverage_content_type :[b'referenceInformation'][2748620 values with dtype=int16]quality_level(time, nj, ni)int8...long_name :[b'quality level of SST pixel']_FillValue :[-128]valid_min :[0]valid_max :[5]comment :[b'thermal IR SST proximity confidence value; signed byte array: WARNING Some applications are unable to properly handle signed byte values.

We use the decode method to do this. The bytestrings are encoded as utf-8, which is a unicode character format. This is the default encoding for decode but we’ve included it as an argument to be explicit.\nNot all attributes are bytestrings. Some are floats. Take a look at _FillValue, and valid_min and valid_max. To avoid an error, we use the isinstance function to check if the value of an attributes is type bytes - a bytestring. If it is, then we decode it. If not, we just extract the scalar and do nothing else.\nWe also fix the global attributes.\ndef fix_attributes(da):\n    '''Decodes bytestring attributes to strings'''\n    for attr, value in da.attrs.items():\n        if isinstance(value[0], bytes):\n            da.attrs[attr] = value[0].decode('utf-8')\n        else:\n            da.attrs[attr] = value[0]\n    return\n\n# Fix variable attributes\nfor var in modis_ds.variables:\n    da = modis_ds[var]\n    fix_attributes(da)\n            \n# Fix global attributes\nfix_attributes(modis_ds)\nWith this done, we can use the xarray function decode_cf to convert the attributes.\nmodis_ds = xr.decode_cf(modis_ds)\n\nmodis_ds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<xarray.Dataset>\nDimensions:                  (nj: 2030, ni: 1354, time: 1)\nCoordinates:\n    lat                      (nj, ni) float32 ...\n    lon                      (nj, ni) float32 ...\n  * time                     (time) datetime64[ns] 2019-06-22T10:00:01\nDimensions without coordinates: nj, ni\nData variables:\n    sea_surface_temperature  (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    sst_dtime                (time, nj, ni) timedelta64[ns] ...\n    quality_level            (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    sses_bias                (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    sses_standard_deviation  (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    l2p_flags                (time, nj, ni) int16 ...\n    chlorophyll_a            (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    K_490                    (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    wind_speed               (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\n    dt_analysis              (time, nj, ni) float32 ...\nAttributes: (12/49)\n    Conventions:                CF-1.7, ACDD-1.3\n    title:                      MODIS Aqua L2P SST\n    summary:                    Sea surface temperature retrievals produced a...\n    references:                 GHRSST Data Processing Specification v2r5\n    institution:                NASA/JPL/OBPG/RSMAS\n    history:                    MODIS L2P created at JPL PO.DAAC\n    ...                         ...\n    publisher_email:            ghrsst-po@nceo.ac.uk\n    processing_level:           L2P\n    cdm_data_type:              swath\n    startDirection:             Ascending\n    endDirection:               Descending\n    day_night_flag:             Dayxarray.DatasetDimensions:nj: 2030ni: 1354time: 1Coordinates: (3)lat(nj, ni)float32...long_name :latitudestandard_name :latitudeunits :degrees_northvalid_min :-90.0valid_max :90.0comment :geographical coordinates, WGS84 projectioncoverage_content_type :coordinate[2748620 values with dtype=float32]lon(nj, ni)float32...long_name :longitudestandard_name :longitudeunits :degrees_eastvalid_min :-180.0valid_max :180.0comment :geographical coordinates, WGS84 projectioncoverage_content_type :coordinate[2748620 values with dtype=float32]time(time)datetime64[ns]2019-06-22T10:00:01long_name :reference time of sst filestandard_name :timecomment :time of first sensor observationcoverage_content_type :coordinatearray(['2019-06-22T10:00:01.000000000'], dtype='datetime64[ns]')Data variables: (10)sea_surface_temperature(time, nj, ni)float32...long_name :sea surface temperaturestandard_name :sea_surface_skin_temperatureunits :kelvinvalid_min :-1000valid_max :10000comment :sea surface temperature from thermal IR (11 um) channelssource :NASA and University of Miamicoverage_content_type :physicalMeasurement[2748620 values with dtype=float32]sst_dtime(time, nj, ni)timedelta64[ns]...long_name :time difference from reference timevalid_min :-32767valid_max :32767comment :time plus sst_dtime gives seconds after 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1981coverage_content_type :referenceInformation[2748620 values with dtype=timedelta64[ns]]quality_level(time, nj, ni)float32...long_name :quality level of SST pixelvalid_min :0valid_max :5comment :thermal IR SST proximity confidence value; signed byte array: WARNING Some applications are unable to properly handle signed byte values.

ICESat-2 sea surface heights are irregularly spaced segments along one ground-track traced by the ATLAS instrument on-board ICESat-2. Fortunately, pyresample allows us to resample swath data.\npyresample has many resampling methods. We’re going to use the nearest neighbour resampling method, which is implemented using a k-dimensional tree algorithm or K-d tree. K-d trees are data structures that improve search efficiency for large data sets.\nThe first step is to define the geometry of the ICESat-2 and MODIS data. To do this we use the latitudes and longitudes of the datasets.\nis2_geometry = pyresample.SwathDefinition(lons=is2_ds.longitude,\n                                          lats=is2_ds.latitude)\nmodis_geometry = pyresample.SwathDefinition(lons=modis_ds.lon, lats=modis_ds.lat)\nWe then implement the resampling method, passing the two geometries we have defined, the data array we want to resample - in this case sea surface temperature, and a search radius. The resampling method expects a numpy.Array rather than an xarray.DataArray, so we use values to get the data as a numpy.Array.\nWe set the search radius to 1000 m. The MODIS data is nominally 1km spacing.\nsearch_radius=1000.\nfill_value = np.nan\nis2_sst = pyresample.kd_tree.resample_nearest(\n    modis_geometry,\n    modis_ds.sea_surface_temperature.values,\n    is2_geometry,\n    search_radius,\n    fill_value=fill_value\n)\n\nis2_sst\n\narray([263.375, 263.375, 263.375, ...,     nan,     nan,     nan],\n      dtype=float32)\n\n\n\nis2_ds['sea_surface_temperature'] = xr.DataArray(is2_sst, dims='segment')\nis2_ds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<xarray.Dataset>\nDimensions:                  (segment: 235584)\nDimensions without coordinates: segment\nData variables:\n    latitude                 (segment) float64 82.38 82.38 82.38 ... 72.61 72.61\n    longitude                (segment) float64 -55.11 -55.11 ... 145.1 145.1\n    delta_time               (segment) float64 4.642e+07 4.642e+07 ... 4.642e+07\n    height_segment_height    (segment) float32 nan nan nan ... -0.4335 -0.4463\n    sea_surface_temperature  (segment) float32 263.4 263.4 263.4 ... nan nan nanxarray.DatasetDimensions:segment: 235584Coordinates: (0)Data variables: (5)latitude(segment)float6482.38 82.38 82.38 ... 72.61 72.61contentType :referenceInformationcoordinates :delta_time longitudedescription :Latitude, WGS84, North=+, Lat of segment centerlong_name :Latitudesource :ATBD, section 4.4standard_name :latitudeunits :degrees_northvalid_max :90.0valid_min :-90.0array([82.38431982, 82.38431982, 82.38431982, ..., 72.60984638,\n       72.60977493, 72.60970985])longitude(segment)float64-55.11 -55.11 ... 145.1 145.1contentType :referenceInformationcoordinates :delta_time latitudedescription :Longitude, WGS84, East=+,Lon of segment centerlong_name :Longitudesource :ATBD, section 4.4standard_name :longitudeunits :degrees_eastvalid_max :180.0valid_min :-180.0array([-55.10896068, -55.10896068, -55.10896068, ..., 145.05396164,\n       145.05392851, 145.05389832])delta_time(segment)float644.642e+07 4.642e+07 ... 4.642e+07CLASS :DIMENSION_SCALENAME :gt1l/sea_ice_segments/delta_timeREFERENCE_LIST :[(<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)\n (<HDF5 object reference>, 0) (<HDF5 object reference>, 0)]contentType :physicalMeasurementcoordinates :latitude longitudedescription :Number of GPS seconds since the ATLAS SDP epoch.

The data are provided as a time series of monthly netCDFs on a 0.5-degree latitude/longitude grid.\nWe will access the data from inside the AWS cloud (us-west-2 region, specifically) and load a time series made of multiple netCDF datasets into a single xarray dataset. This approach leverages S3 native protocols for efficient access to the data.\n\n\nRequirements\n\nAWS\nThis notebook should be running in an EC2 instance in AWS region us-west-2, as previously mentioned. We recommend using an EC2 with at least 8GB of memory available.\nThe notebook was developed and tested using a t2.small instance (_ CPUs; 8GB memory).

While the context manager is open (rio_env.__enter__()) we will be able to run the open or get data commands that would typically be executed within a with statement, thus allowing us to more freely interact with the data. We’ll close the context (rio_env.__exit__()) at the end of the notebook.\nGDAL environment variables must be configured to access COGs from Earthdata Cloud. Geospatial data access Python packages like rasterio and rioxarray depend on GDAL, leveraging GDAL’s “Virtual File Systems” to read remote files. GDAL has a lot of environment variables that control it’s behavior. Changing these settings can mean the difference being able to access a file or not. They can also have an impact on the performance.\nrio_env = rio.Env(GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN='TRUE',\n                  GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEFILE=os.path.expanduser('~/cookies.txt'),\n                  GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEJAR=os.path.expanduser('~/cookies.txt'))\nrio_env.__enter__()\nIn this example we’re interested in the HLS L30 data collection from NASA’s LP DAAC in Earthdata Cloud.

    "text": "Workspace Environment Setup\nFor this exercise, we are going to open up a context manager for the notebook using the rasterio.env module to store the required GDAL and AWS configurations we need to access the data in Earthdata Cloud. While the context manager is open (rio_env.__enter__()) we will be able to run the open or get data commands that would typically be executed within a with statement, thus allowing us to more freely interact with the data. We’ll close the context (rio_env.__exit__()) at the end of the notebook.\nCreate a boto3 Session object using your temporary credentials. This Session is used to pass credentials and configuration to AWS so we can interact wit S3 objects from applicable buckets.\nsession = boto3.Session(aws_access_key_id=temp_creds_req['accessKeyId'], \n                        aws_secret_access_key=temp_creds_req['secretAccessKey'],\n                        aws_session_token=temp_creds_req['sessionToken'],\n                        region_name='us-west-2')\nGDAL environment variables must be configured to access COGs in Earthdata Cloud. Geospatial data access Python packages like rasterio and rioxarray depend on GDAL, leveraging GDAL’s “Virtual File Systems” to read remote files. GDAL has a lot of environment variables that control it’s behavior. Changing these settings can mean the difference being able to access a file or not. They can also have an impact on the performance.\nrio_env = rio.Env(AWSSession(session),\n                  GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN='TRUE',\n                  GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEFILE=os.path.expanduser('~/cookies.txt'),\n                  GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEJAR=os.path.expanduser('~/cookies.txt'))\nrio_env.__enter__()\nIn this example we’re interested in the HLS L30 data collection from NASA’s LP DAAC in Earthdata Cloud.

While the data can be downloaded locally, the cloud offers the ability to scale compute resources to perform analyses over large areas and time spans, which is critical as data volumes continue to grow.\nAlthough the examples we’re working with in this notebook only focuses on a small time and area for demonstration purposes, this workflow can be modified and scaled up to suit a larger time range and region of interest.\n\nDatasets of interest:\n\nHarmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) Operational Land Imager Surface Reflectance and TOA Brightness Daily Global 30m v2.0 (L30) (10.5067/HLS/HLSL30.002)\n\nSurface reflectance (SR) and top of atmosphere (TOA) brightness data\nGlobal observations of the land every 2–3 days at 30-meter (m)\nCloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format\n\nECCO Sea Surface Height - Daily Mean 0.5 Degree (Version 4 Release 4)(10.5067/ECG5D-SSH44).\n\nDaily-averaged dynamic sea surface height\nTime series of monthly NetCDFs on a 0.5-degree latitude/longitude grid."

There are several ways to do this. One way to connect the search part of the workflow we just did in Earthdata Search to our next steps working in the cloud is to simply copy/paste the s3:// links provides in Step 4 above into a JupyterHub notebook or script in our cloud workspace, and continue the data analysis from there.\nOne could also copy/paste the s3:// links and save them in a text file, then open and read the text file in the notebook or script in the JupyterHub in the cloud.\n\n\n\nFigure caption: Direct S3 access"

The COGs can be used like any other GeoTIFF file, but have some added features that make them more efficient within the cloud data access paradigm. These features include: overviews and internal tiling.\n\nBut first, what is STAC?\nSpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) is a specification that provides a common language for interpreting geospatial information in order to standardize indexing and discovering data.\nThe STAC specification is made up of a collection of related, yet independent specifications that when used together provide search and discovery capabilities for remote assets.\n\nFour STAC Specifications\nSTAC Catalog (aka DAAC Archive)\nSTAC Collection (aka Data Product)\nSTAC Item (aka Granule)\nSTAC API\n\n\n\nCMR-STAC API\nThe CMR-STAC API is NASA’s implementation of the STAC API specification for all NASA data holdings within EOSDIS. The current implementation does not allow for querries accross the entire NASA catalog. Users must execute searches within provider catalogs (e.g., LPCLOUD) to find the STAC Items they are searching for. All the providers can be found at the CMR-STAC endpoint here: https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/stac/.\nIn this example, we will query the LPCLOUD provider to identify STAC Items from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) collection that fall within our region of interest (ROI) and within our specified time range."

The rasterio package is no exception. Rasterio leverages GDAL to, among other things, read and write raster data files, e.g., GeoTIFFs/Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs. To read remote files, i.e., files/objects stored in the cloud, GDAL uses its Virtual File System API. In a perfect world, one would be able to point a Virtual File System (there are several) at a remote data asset and have the asset retrieved, but that is not always the case. GDAL has a host of configurations/environmental variables that adjust its behavior to, for example, make a request more performant or to pass AWS credentials to the distribution system.

The sources of data are satellite (AVHRR) and in situ platforms (i.e., ships and buoys), and the specific datasets employed may change over. At the marginal ice zone, sea ice concentrations are used to generate proxy SSTs.  A preliminary version of this file is produced in near-real time (1-day latency), and then replaced with a final version after 2 weeks. Note that this is the AVHRR-ONLY DOISST, available from Oct 1981, but there is a companion DOISST product that includes microwave satellite data, available from June 2002.time_coverage_start :19810901T000000Ztime_coverage_end :19810902T000000Zuuid :39832cc3-d409-438a-820e-2bb1b38ebca8DODS_EXTRA.Unlimited_Dimension :time\n\n\n\nopd_sst_ds.analysed_sst.isel(time=0).hvplot.image(cmap='Inferno')\n\nUnable to display output for mime type(s):"

    "text": "Getting Started\nWe will access monthly ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data from ECCO V4r4 (10.5067/ECG5M-OBP44), which are provided as a monthly time series on a 0.5-degree latitude/longitude grid.\nThe data are archived in netCDF format. However, this notebook demonstration will request conversion to Zarr format for files covering the period between 2010 and 2018. Upon receiving our request, Harmony’s backend will convert the files and stage them in S3 for native access in AWS (us-west-2 region, specifically). We will access the new Zarr datasets as an aggregated dataset using xarray, and leverage the S3 native protocols for direct access to the data in an efficient manner.\n\n\nRequirements\n\nAWS\nThis notebook should be running in an EC2 instance in AWS region us-west-2, as previously mentioned. We recommend using an EC2 with at least 8GB of memory available.\nThe notebook was developed and tested using a t2.large instance (2 cpus; 8GB memory).\n\n\nPython 3\nMost of these imports are from the Python standard library.

Support for selection by the dataset ShortName will be added in a future release.\n\nCommon Metadata Repository (CMR)\nFor now, we will need to get the concept-id that corresponds to our dataset by accessing its metadata from the CMR.
