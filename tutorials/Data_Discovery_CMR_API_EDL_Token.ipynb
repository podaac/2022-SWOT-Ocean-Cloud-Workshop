Along the way we will explore the available search parameters, information return, and specific contrains when using the CMR API.

    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Earthdata Login\n",
    "\n",
    "An Earthdata Login account is required to access data, as well as discover restricted data, from the NASA Earthdata system. Thus, to access NASA data, you need Earthdata Login. Please visit https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov to register and manage your Earthdata Login account. This account is free to create and only takes a moment to set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand what CMR/CMR API is and what CMR/CMR API can be used for \n",
    "- how to use the `requests` package to search data collections and granules\n",
    "- how to use an Earthdata Login token to search for data with access control lists\n",
    "- how to parse the results of these searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is CMR\n",
    "CMR is the Common Metadata Repository.  It catalogs all data for NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).  It is the backend of [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search), the GUI search interface you are probably familiar with.  More information about CMR can be found [here](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/cmr).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the GUI for Earthdata Search is not accessible from a cloud instance - at least not without some work.  Earthdata Search is also not immediately reproducible.  What I mean by that is if you create a search using the GUI you would have to note the search criteria (date range, search area, collection name, etc), take a screenshot, copy the search url, or save the list of data granules returned by the search, in order to recreate the search.  This information would have to be re-entered each time you or someone else wanted to do the search.  You could make typos or other mistakes.  A cleaner, reproducible solution is to search CMR programmatically using the CMR API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the CMR API\n",
    "API stands for Application Programming Interface.  It allows applications (software, services, etc) to send information to each other.  A helpful analogy is a waiter in a restaurant.  The waiter takes your drink or food order that you select from the menu, often translated into short-hand, to the bar or kitchen, and then returns (hopefully) with what you ordered when it is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CMR API accepts search terms such as collection name, keywords, datetime range, and location, queries the CMR database and returns the results."
